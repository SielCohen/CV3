  <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet">From what clarinets made of?</a></h2>
  <p>The clarinet is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument. Like many wind instruments, clarinets are made in several different sizes, each having its own range of pitches. All have a nearly-cylindrical bore and a flared bell, and utilize a
    mouthpiece with a single reed. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).

    While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name, other factors may have been involved. During the Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills
    of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, "clarion" register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of
    the highest part of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to produce scales of adjacent notes. The trumpet parts that required this specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to the
    musicians themselves. The word clarinet may have come from the diminutive version of the clarion or clarino and it has been suggested that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing particularly difficult passages on these newly
    developed "mock trumpets".[1]

  Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to
  improve the tone and playability.[2]

  The most common clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. The clarinet in A, pitched a semitone lower, is also regularly used in orchestral, chamber, and solo music. The bass clarinet has been common in orchestras since the middle of the 19th century. The
  modern bass clarinet is in B♭ but has extra keys to extend the register down to low written C3. The clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB♭ octo-contrabass to the A♭ piccolo clarinet. The clarinet is used in classical music, concert
  bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles. </p>
